# LaTeX_to_HTML
This repository contains source files for one of my assignment projects in the college. It contains the required files for a LaTeX to HTML compiler.<br>
The Compiler made is a limited version of the overall compiler in the market. It converts only limited content and tags of LaTeX into HTML.
The project has used flex utility for lexical analysis and bison utility for making the parser. The supporting files are coded in C++.<br>
